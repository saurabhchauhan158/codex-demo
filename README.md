# codex-demo

This is a temporary project created for learning and experimenting with GitHub Copilot/Codex capabilities.

## 🚀 Purpose

To explore how GitHub Copilot (Codex) can assist in code generation, completion, and suggestions across different languages and scenarios.

## 🧪 What I'm Trying

- Writing small scripts in Python, JavaScript, and Go
- Exploring how Codex handles comments-to-code generation
- Testing integration with GitHub repositories
- Experimenting with prompt-based coding assistance

## 🗂️ Structure (may change)
